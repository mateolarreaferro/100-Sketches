# 100 Sketches
 My intention is to make 100 sketches in a year. These are created using p5.js, processing, unity, max(jitter), and vqgan+clip.
 
 If anything, the purpose of this challenge is to learn more about the art of creative coding and the tools that currently available. 

## Inspiration/Sources
A lot of the sketches in this repository were created following tutorials from these channels:
